# Harvard CS50x Track by Dat N. Le

> Harvard CS50x structured learning using P.A.C.E.R. loops, verified logs, and public outputs.

## Purpose

### **`CS50x's Learning = self-directed systems + protocol discipline + public artifacts`**

This is the my official CS50x's Track for constructing trackable learning systems from any course, project, or domain. Use this to:

- Structure your learning as **iteration cycles**, not passive consumption, verification (via P.A.C.E.R. protocol)
- Produce **trackable insights**, not fleeting thoughts, log-traceable progression
- Ship **public artifacts**, not private illusions
- Crystallize ⌬ **Mindstamps** — reusable thinking units, based on Second Mind OS OVL Protocol

> This repo to convert any study of CS50x into a systemized execution protocol.

### 🔁 P.A.C.E.R. Loop Protocol

Each learning unit runs through the **P.A.C.E.R. loop** — a minimal feedback protocol for deliberate skill formation:

| Stage     | Function                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Plan`    | Define objective, scope, and constraint |
| `Act`     | Execute, build, engage with material    |
| `Check`   | Self-test, validate via examples/tests  |
| `Edit`    | Refactor, simplify, correct blindspots  |
| `Reflect` | Meta-log insights, blockers, claims     |
