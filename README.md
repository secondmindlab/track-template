# Track Template Protocol by Second Mind OS (SMOS)

> Track your thinking. Loop your learning. Build public artifacts. Powered by SMOS.

**Canonical template** for learning tracks, project-based skill loops, and knowledge pipelines in the 🧱 Second Mind OS Lab.

## Purpose

### **`Learning = self-directed systems + protocol discipline + public artifacts`**

> Maximize your leverage. Build your cognitive stack. Ship high-signal work.

This is not a note-taking system.
This is not a journaling habit.
This is a **feedback loop protocol** — to think clearer, track deeper, and verify what you actually know.

This is the **official template** for constructing trackable learning systems from any course, project, or domain. Use this to:

- Structure your learning as **iteration cycles**, not passive consumption, verification (via P.A.C.E.R. protocol)
- Produce **trackable insights**, not fleeting thoughts, log-traceable progression
- Ship **public artifacts**, not private illusions
- Crystallize ⌬ **Mindstamps** — reusable thinking units, based on Second Mind OS OVL Protocol

> Fork this repo to convert any study path into a systemized execution protocol.

### 🔁 P.A.C.E.R. Loop Protocol

Each learning unit runs through the **P.A.C.E.R. loop** — a minimal feedback protocol for deliberate skill formation:

| Stage     | Function                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Plan`    | Define objective, scope, and constraint |
| `Act`     | Execute, build, engage with material    |
| `Check`   | Self-test, validate via examples/tests  |
| `Edit`    | Refactor, simplify, correct blindspots  |
| `Reflect` | Meta-log insights, blockers, claims     |

Each folder in `loop/week-xx-x/` should contain a `pacer.yaml` or markdown journal documenting this cycle.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fork this template** → rename to `USERNAME/[course|domain]` or `USERNAME/track-[course|domain]`
   e.g.: `track-cs50x`, `track-ml-zero`, `track-rust-os`

2. **Optional: Enable GitHub Pages**
   → Serve `outputs/` as public-facing artifacts

3. **Loop Structure**
   - New loop via CLI (Recommend) `python scripts/smos.py week-01-c --topic="Memory & Pointers"`
   - Drop notes into `docs/`
   - Write blockers / insight logs in `logs/`
   - Launch a loop via `loop/week-01-c/pacer.yaml`, `loop/week-01-c/claim.md`, `loop/week-01-c/reflect.md`
   - Push deliverables to `outputs/`

#### Example:

```bash
track-cs50x/
├── docs/week-01-c.md                  # Schema of memory model
├── logs/YYYY-MM-DD-week-01-c.md       # Blocker resolution
├── loop/week-01-c/pacer.yaml          # P.A.C.E.R. config
├── loop/week-01-c/claim.md            # Distilled knowledge lock
├── loop/week-01-c/reflect.md          # Meta-log & feedback
├── outputs/week-01-c/output.md        # Artifact: reflection + code
```

#### Naming Convention (Optional):

Track repos should follow:

```
[course|domain|theme]
track-[course|domain|theme]
```

Examples:

- `cs50x`
- `openai-fine-tune`
- `track-ml-zero`
- `track-rust-os`
- `track-freecodecamp-js`

Use as **public fork base** for consistent naming across teams/orgs.

#### Recommended Add-ons

- [ ] GitHub Actions for JSON metadata export
- [ ] Auto-log CLI script (`log "note here"`)
- [ ] Auto-site render via `outputs/` → `gh-pages`
