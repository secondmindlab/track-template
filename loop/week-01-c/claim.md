# ⌬ Claim — Week 01: [Topic]

## 1. 📣 Claim

- **Fact Lock-in**: (knowledge)  
  Eg: “I understand the difference between stack and heap memory.”

- **Skill Capability**: (actionable)  
  Eg: “I can debug null-pointer segfaults in C using `valgrind` and logical tracing.”

- **Insight Shift**: (mindset / abstraction layer upgrade)  
  Eg: “Pointers are not just addresses — they represent indirection, which generalizes to references in high-level langs.”

## 2. Evidence

- Verified via: [`logs/YYYY-MM-DD-week-01-c.md`](/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-week-01-c.md)
- Output artifact: [`outputs/week-01-c/output.md`](/outputs/week-01-c/output.md)
- Source of knowledge: CS50x Lectures + Pset1

## 3. Note

This ⌬ **Mindstamp** represents a crystallized loop outcome.
