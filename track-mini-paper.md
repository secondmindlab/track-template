## 1. Title & Identity

```markdown
# Track Mini Paper ‚Äî [Track Name]

## 2. Abstract (80‚Äì150 words)

- What was this track about?
- What challenge/problem/skill space did it focus on?
- What‚Äôs the **one-sentence** leverage I gained?

```markdown
### Abstract

This track focused on [...].  
The key insight was [...].  
What started as [...] evolved into a system for [...].
```

## 3. Learning Objective

| Category         | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal             | What was the original intent of learning this?             |
| Scope            | What‚Äôs in/out of scope? (tools, theory, domain boundaries) |
| Protocol Applied | PACER loops, loop-log cards, symbolic ‚å¨/‚ñ£ mapping used?    |
| Loop Coverage    | Number of loops completed, % of track mapped               |

## 4. Process Structure

```markdown
### Loop Lifecycle Applied

- Total loops completed: 6
- Avg loop duration: 2.5h
- Each loop followed: Plan ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Reflect
- Logs created: 6
- Insight claims ‚å¨: 9 (4 escalated to reusable claim cards)
```

## 5. Key Insight Claims (‚å¨ Table)

| ‚å¨ ID | Insight Statement                                    | Trigger | Verified in                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| 001  | "Refactoring reveals abstraction boundaries."        | pset 1  | `logs/2025-06-02-week-01-c.md` |
| 004  | "Validation ‚â† correctness ‚Äî it's protocol fidelity." | lecture | `loop/week-01-c/reflect.md`    |
| 005  | "Debugging isn't reactive ‚Äî it's system tracing."    | lab     | `loop/week-02-debug/log.md`    |

_(Limit table to 3‚Äì5 top insights. Add footnote if more.)_

## 6. Pattern & Systemic Reflection

```markdown
### Execution Pattern

- I recognized a recurring decision pattern: [...]
- I shifted from task-based to pattern-first thinking in: [...]
- This changed how I write, debug, and structure code.

### Meta-Insight

> ‚ÄúProgramming is not syntax execution ‚Äî it‚Äôs **system behavior control**.‚Äù
```

Pin this paper at the top of your repo (README) with your `loop-card.png`.
It becomes your **cognitive contract** with the public.
